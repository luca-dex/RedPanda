pyTSA
=====

Many dynamical systems are often analyzed by performing simulation ensembles under different
parameter configurations. Automatizing time-series analysis is key to save time and focus on other
modeling tasks. pyTSA is an open source Python tool to make data-analysis as intuitive as possible.
Its scripts can be processed in a pipeline with any simulation tool outputting time-series, and intuitive
commands allow to perform complex analyses.

Current pyTSA version supports the following plots, in many graphical formats: single traces
(single panel or multi panel), average and standard deviation of a dataset (with barplot or traces,
single panel or multi panel), 2D/3D probability density function of a quantity at some specific time
point (with normalization and gaussian fit), 2D/3D time-varying probability density function of a
quantity in a time-interval (heatmap or surface) and 2D/3D phase-space.
